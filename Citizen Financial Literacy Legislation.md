## SECTION 2 - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

There is extensive debate regarding the efficacy of financial literacy education and the 
correlation between applied knowledge of personal finance best known methods and overall good financial health/satisfaction.  There has been very little data collection with enough participants over a long enough time to make effective causal correlation between financial literacy education and long term financial behavior (Robb).

This legislation introduces general requirements in the Massachusetts K - 12 Public Education and Charter School curriculum for financial literacy educational inclusion.  It provides data collection and standardized testing outlines for evaluation of financial literacy education effectiveness.

This legislation commissions the creation of an opt-in voluntary study in which students graduating the Massachusetts Public or Charter School System allow the ongoing, long-term collection of income, credit worthiness, and other financial health and satisfaction metrics as defined by the study authors.

This legislation is designed to provide both financial literacy education and the means to populate good data for evaluating the efficacy of financial literacy education over long-term periods, into adult life.  The goal is to find enough data to evaluate the causality between financial literacy education and good financial habits with respect to a wide set of demographic data in real world scenarios.
